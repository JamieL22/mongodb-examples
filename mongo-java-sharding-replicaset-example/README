About
=======================================

A simple Mongo sharding (with replica sets) setup example using Mongo/Java/Ant.

See: http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Sharding and http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Replica+Sets

Prerequisites
=======================================

You must have Ant installed and in your $PATH.

You must have Mongo installed and the bin files in your $PATH.

Running
=======================================

Open a terminal window and run:

* ant run

This runs three shard servers (four including the replicas), two arbiters, three config servers and two mongos servers.

The ports are:

    * mongo-shard-0     : 27018
    * mongo-shard-0a    : 27019 (this is a replica of mongo-shard-0)
    * mongo-arbiter-0   : 27023
    * mongo-shard-1     : 27020
    * mongo-shard-1a    : 27021 (this is a replica of mongo-shard-1)
    * mongo-arbiter-0   : 27024
    * mongo-config-0    : 27022
    * mongo-config-1    : 27025
    * mongo-config-2    : 27026
    * mongos            : 27017
    * mongos            : 27030

The run command will start your mongo servers and initialize your replica sets, shard cluster and run a couple
of simple tests. This command takes a while to run because it waits (sleeps) to make sure the replica sets and
cluster are setup.

The run command will not exit untl CTRL-C is hit. CTRL-C also kills your mongo processes.

Note: If you run "ant clean" this deletes the temp database files stored in build/*.

Note: This was last tested with 2.4.1, but it should work with other versions as well.
